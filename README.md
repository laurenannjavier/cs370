Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In project two, I developed code to manage the creation of each episode and epoch loops, including when to switch between random moves and the quality algorithm. It also incorporated mechanisms to reference actions taken in the neural network for use in future episodes, as well as tracking win and loss states. The project included both the Keras library and its dependencies, along with the model structure for the neural network. Additionally, it featured controllers for default variables such as model parameters and the number of episodes, which are used to initiate the treasure hunter program.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
My goal is to develop solutions that are both intuitive and efficient, benefiting humanity through the use of computers. Through this course, I have deepened my understanding of AI and its role in the evolving landscape of computer science. With this knowledge, I can bring automation and simplicity to computer programs by incorporating AI into future projects. These solutions are not only significant for me as the creator but also for the individuals who interact with them. Additionally, I have gained an appreciation for regulations, which protect people and their data in the context of AI technologies.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problem-solving by questioning how I can improve a situation, how my solution benefits others, whether there are better alternatives, and whether my solution aligns with ethical principles. By asking these questions, I strive to ensure that my work is not only effective and beneficial to everyone but also ethically sound, promoting fairness and avoiding any harm. This helps me create solutions that are both impactful and responsible.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
With regulations in place, protecting individuals’ data and ensuring its ethical use is a fundamental responsibility for everyone in a computer science role. As a computer scientist, safeguarding a user’s best interests is just as crucial as writing useful code. If the code you write doesn’t prioritize the protection of individuals, ethics are especially crucial when handling user data. Data should be used only when necessary, anonymized whenever possible, and securely protected from unauthorized access. This approach makes sure that our solutions not only meet technical requirements but also uphold ethical standards that prioritize user privacy and trust.
